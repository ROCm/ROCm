### Zero value is displayed in ROCTx aggregated statistics

The ROCTx markers are standalone markers within the ROCProfiler-SDK library. Each marker reports only a single timestamp, which is recorded as the `start_timestamp` and `end_timestamp`. As a result, the value for aggregated statistics presented in `TotalDurationNs`, `maxNs`, and `minNs`, is zero. The zero value indicates that the actual execution time is not associated with the markers, which is an expected behavior.
