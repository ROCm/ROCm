## ROCm upcoming changes

The following changes to the ROCm software stack are anticipated for future releases.

### ROCTracer and ROCProfiler (rocprof and rocprofv2) deprecation

Development and support for ROCTracer and ROCProfiler (`rocprof` and `rocprofv2`) will phase out in favor of ROCprofiler-SDK (`rocprofv3`) in upcoming ROCm releases. Going forward, only critical defect fixes will be addressed for older versions of profiling tools and libraries. Upgrade to the latest version of ROCprofiler-SDK (`rocprofv3`) library to ensure continued support and access to new features.

### AMDGPU wavefront size compiler macro deprecation

The `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE__` macro will be deprecated in an upcoming
release. It is recommended to remove any use of this macro. For more information, see [AMDGPU
support](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/llvm-project/en/docs-6.3.3/LLVM/clang/html/AMDGPUSupport.html).

### HIPCC Perl scripts deprecation

The HIPCC Perl scripts (`hipcc.pl` and `hipconfig.pl`) will be removed in an upcoming release.
