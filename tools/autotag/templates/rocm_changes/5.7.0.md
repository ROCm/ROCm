#### TensorFlower Support Reduction

ROCm 5.7 deviates from the standard practice of supporting the last three
TensorFlow versions. This is due to incompatibilities between earlier TensorFlow
versions and changes introduced in the ROCm 5.6 compiler. Refer to the following
version support matrix:

| ROCm  | TensorFlow |
|:-----:|:----------:|
| 5.6.x | 2.12       |
| 5.7.0 | 2.12, 2.13 |
| Post-5.7.0 | Last three versions at ROCm release. |
