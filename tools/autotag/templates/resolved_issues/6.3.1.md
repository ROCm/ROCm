## ROCm resolved issues

The following are previously known issues resolved in this release. For resolved issues related to
individual components, review the [Detailed component changes](#detailed-component-changes).

### Instinct MI300 series: backward weights convolution performance issue

Fixed a performance issue affecting certain tensor shapes during backward weights convolution when using FP16 or FP32 data types on Instinct MI300 series accelerators. See [GitHub issue #4080](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4080).

### ROCm Compute Profiler and ROCm Systems Profiler post-upgrade issues

Packaging metadata for ROCm Compute Profiler (`rocprofiler-compute`) and ROCm Systems Profiler
(`rocprofiler-systems`) has been updated to handle the renaming from Omniperf and Omnitrace,
respectively. This fixes minor issues when upgrading from ROCm 6.2 to 6.3. For more information, see the GitHub issues
[#4082](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4082) and
[#4083](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4082).

### Stale file due to OpenCL ICD loader deprecation

When upgrading from ROCm 6.2.x to ROCm 6.3.0, the issue of removal of the `rocm-icd-loader` package
leaving a stale file in the old `rocm-6.2.x` directory has been resolved. The stale files left during
the upgrade from ROCm 6.2.x to ROCm 6.3.0 will be removed when upgrading to ROCm 6.3.1. For more
information, see [GitHub issue #4084](https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm/issues/4084).
