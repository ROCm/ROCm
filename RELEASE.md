#### hipBLAS 1.1.0

hipBLAS 1.1.0 for ROCm 5.7.0

##### Changed

- updated documentation requirements

##### Dependencies

- dependency rocSOLVER now depends on rocSPARSE

hipCUB 2.13.1 for ROCm 5.7.0

##### Changed

- CUB backend references CUB and Thrust version 2.0.1.
- Fixed `DeviceSegmentedReduce::ArgMin` and `DeviceSegmentedReduce::ArgMax` by returning the segment-relative index instead of the absolute one.

##### Known Issues

- `debug_synchronous` no longer works on CUDA platform. `CUB_DEBUG_SYNC` should be used to enable those checks.
- `DeviceReduce::Sum` does not compile on CUDA platform for mixed extended-floating-point/floating-point InputT and OutputT types.

  - Level 1: axpy, copy, rot, rotm, scal, swap, asum, dot, iamax, iamin, nrm2

  - fix in-place functionality for all trtri sizes

##### Changed

- dot when using rocblas_pointer_mode_host is now synchronous to match legacy BLAS as it stores results in host memory
- enhanced reporting of installation issues caused by runtime libraries (Tensile)
- standardized internal rocblas C++ interface across most functions

##### Deprecated

- Removal of __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ define in future release

##### Dependencies

- optional build tool only dependency on python psutil

#### rocFFT 1.0.24

rocFFT 1.0.24 for ROCm 5.7.0

##### Optimizations

- Improved performance of complex forward/inverse 1D FFTs (2049 &lt;= length &lt;= 131071) that use Bluestein&#39;s algorithm.

##### Added

- Implemented a solution map version converter and finish the first conversion from ver.0 to ver.1. Where version 1 removes some incorrect kernels (sbrc/sbcr using half_lds)

##### Changed

- Moved rocfft_rtc_helper executable to lib/rocFFT directory on Linux.
- Moved library kernel cache to lib/rocFFT directory.

#### rocPRIM 2.13.1

rocPRIM 2.13.1 for ROCm 5.7.0

##### Changed

- Deprecated configuration `radix_sort_config` for device-level radix sort as it no longer matches the algorithm&#39;s parameters. New configuration `radix_sort_config_v2` is preferred instead.
- Removed erroneous implementation of device-level `inclusive_scan` and `exclusive_scan`. The prior default implementation using lookback-scan now is the only available implementation.
- The benchmark metric indicating the bytes processed for `exclusive_scan_by_key` and `inclusive_scan_by_key` has been changed to incorporate the key type. Furthermore, the benchmark log has been changed such that these algorithms are reported as `scan` and `scan_by_key` instead of `scan_exclusive` and `scan_inclusive`.
- Deprecated configurations `scan_config` and `scan_by_key_config` for device-level scans, as they no longer match the algorithm&#39;s parameters. New configurations `scan_config_v2` and `scan_by_key_config_v2` are preferred instead.

##### Fixed

Likewise, `benchmark_curand_host_api` is added to replace `benchmark_curand_generate` and `benchmark_curand_device_api` is added to replace `benchmark_curand_kernel`.
