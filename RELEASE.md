- rocblas_set_int8_type_for_hipblas was deprecated and is now removed.
- rocblas_get_int8_type_for_hipblas was deprecated and is now removed.

##### Dependencies

- Implemented a first version of offline-tuner to support tuning kernels for C2C/Z2Z problems.

##### Changed

- Replaced std::complex with hipComplex data types for data generator.
- FFT plan dimensions are now sorted to be row-major internally where possible, which produces better plans if the dimensions were accidentally specified in a different order (column-major, for example).
- Added --precision argument to benchmark/test clients.  --double is still accepted but is deprecated as a method to request a double-precision transform.

##### Fixed

- Fixed over-allocation of LDS in some real-complex kernels, which was resulting in kernel launch failure.
