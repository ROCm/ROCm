# MI200 High Performance Computing and Tuning Guide

## System Settings

This chapter reviews system settings that are required to configure the system
for AMD Instinct™ MI250 accelerators and that can improve performance of the
GPUs. It is advised to configure the system for best possible host configuration
according to the "High Performance Computing (HPC) Tuning Guide for AMD EPYC™
7002 Series Processors" or "High Performance Computing (HPC) Tuning Guide for
AMD EPYC™ 7003 Series Processors" depending on the processor generation of the
system.

In addition to the BIOS settings listed below, the following settings (Section
3.1) must also be enacted via the command line (see Section 3.2):

- Core C states
- IOMMU (if needed)

### System BIOS Settings

For maximum MI250 GPU performance on systems with AMD EPYC™ 7003-series
processors (codename "Milan") and AMI System BIOS, the following configuration
of system BIOS settings has been validated. These settings must be used for the
qualification process and should be set as default values for the system BIOS.
Analogous settings for other non-AMI System BIOS providers could be set
similarly. For systems with Intel processors, some settings may not apply or be
available as listed in Table 2.
