Using GPU Sanitizer

The LLVM Address Sanitizer provides a process that allows developers to detect runtime addressing errors in applications and libraries. The detection is achieved using a combination of compiler-added instrumentation and runtime techniques, including function interception and replacement.

Until now, the LLVM Address Sanitizer process was only available for traditional purely CPU applications. However, ROCm has extended this mechanism to additionally allow the detection of some addressing errors on the GPU in heterogeneous applications. Ideally, developers should treat heterogeneous HIP and OpenMP applications exactly like pure CPU applications. However, this simplicity has not been achieved yet.

This document provides documentation on using ROCm Address Sanitizer. For information about LLVM Address Sanitizer, see https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html
