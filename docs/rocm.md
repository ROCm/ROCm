# What is ROCm?

ROCm is an open-source stack for GPU computation. ROCm is primarily Open-Source
Software (OSS) that allows developers the freedom to customize and tailor their
GPU software for their own needs while collaborating with a community of other
developers, and helping each other find solutions in an agile, flexible, rapid,
and secure manner.

ROCm is a collection of drivers, development tools and APIs enabling GPU
programming from the low-level kernel to end-user applications.

ROCm is powered by AMD’s Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP),
an OSS C++ GPU programming environment and its corresponding runtime.
HIP allows ROCm developers to create portable applications on different platforms
by deploying code on a range of platforms, from dedicated gaming GPUs to exascale
High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters.

ROCm supports programming models such as OpenMP and OpenCL,
and includes all the necessary OSS compilers, debuggers, and libraries.
ROCm is fully integrated into ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. ROCm can be
deployed in many ways, including through the use of containers such as Docker,
Spack, and your own build from source.

ROCm’s goal is to allow our users to maximize their GPU hardware investment.
ROCm is designed to help develop, test and deploy GPU accelerated HPC, AI,
scientific computing, CAD, and other applications in a free, open-source,
integrated, and secure software ecosystem.
