TensorFlow compatibility
*******************************************************************************

`TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ is an open-source library for
solving machine learning, deep learning, and AI problems. It can solve many
problems across different sectors and industries but primarily focuses on
neural network training and inference. It is one of the most popular and
in-demand frameworks and is very active in open-source contribution and
development.

The `official TensorFlow repository <http://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`_
includes full ROCm support. AMD maintains a TensorFlow `ROCm repository
<http://github.com/rocm/tensorflow-upstream>`_ in order to quickly add bug
fixes, updates, and support for the latest ROCM versions.

- ROCm TensorFlow release:

  - Offers :ref:`Docker images <tensorflow-docker-compat>` with
    ROCm and TensorFlow pre-installed.

  - ROCm TensorFlow repository: `<https://github.com/ROCm/tensorflow-upstream>`_

  - See the :doc:`ROCm TensorFlow installation guide <rocm-install-on-linux:install/3rd-party/tensorflow-install>`
    to get started.

- Official TensorFlow release:

  - Official TensorFlow repository: `<https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow>`_

  - See the `TensorFlow API versions <https://www.tensorflow.org/versions>`_ list.

  .. note::

     The official TensorFlow documentation does not cover ROCm support. Use the
     ROCm documentation for installation instructions for Tensorflow on ROCm.
     See :doc:`rocm-install-on-linux:install/3rd-party/tensorflow-install`.

Use cases and recommendations
===============================================================================

* The `Training a Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) Recommender on an AMD
  GPU <https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/artificial-intelligence/ncf/README.html>`_
  blog post discusses training an NCF recommender system using TensorFlow. It
  explains how NCF improves traditional collaborative filtering methods by
  leveraging neural networks to model non-linear user-item interactions. The
  post outlines the implementation using the recommenders library, focusing on
  the use of implicit data (for example, user interactions like viewing or
  purchasing) and how it addresses challenges like the lack of negative values.

* The `Creating a PyTorch/TensorFlow code environment on AMD GPUs
  <https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/software-tools-optimization/pytorch-tensorflow-env/README.html>`_
  blog post provides instructions for creating a machine learning environment
  for PyTorch and TensorFlow on AMD GPUs using ROCm. It covers steps like
  installing the libraries, cloning code repositories, installing dependencies,
  and troubleshooting potential issues with CUDA-based code. Additionally, it
  explains how to HIPify code (port CUDA code to HIP) and manage Docker images
  for a better experience on AMD GPUs. This guide aims to help data scientists
  and ML practitioners adapt their code for AMD GPUs.

For more use cases and recommendations, see the `ROCm Tensorflow blog posts <https://rocm.blogs.amd.com/blog/tag/tensorflow.html>`_.
