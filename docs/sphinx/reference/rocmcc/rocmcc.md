# Introduction to Compiler Reference Guide

ROCmCC is a Clang/LLVM-based compiler. It is optimized for high-performance computing on AMD GPUs and CPUs and supports various heterogenous programming models such as HIP, OpenMP, and OpenCL.

ROCmCC is made available via two packages: rocm-llvm and rocm-llvm-alt. The differences are shown in this table:

| <b>Table 1. rocm-llvm vs. rocm-llvm-alt</b>|
