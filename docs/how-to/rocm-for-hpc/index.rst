Using ROCm for HPC
******************

The ROCm™ open-source software stack is optimized to extract the best high
performance computing (HPC) workload performance from AMD Instinct™ accelerators
while maintaining compatibility with industry software frameworks.

For more information, see :doc:`What is ROCm? <../../what-is-rocm>`.

Some of the most popular HPC frameworks are part of the ROCm platform, including
those to help parallelize operations across multiple GPUs and servers, handle
memory hierarchies, and solve linear systems.

Our GPU Accelerated Applications Catalog includes a vast set of
platform-compatible HPC applications, including those in astrophysics, climate 
and weather, computational chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, earth
science, genomics, geophysics, molecular dynamics, and physics. Many of these
are available through the AMD Infinity Hub, build instructions ready for users
to install and run on servers with AMD Instinct accelerators.
