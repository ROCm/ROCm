Installing deep learning frameworks for ROCm
********************************************

ROCm provides a comprehensive ecosystem for deep learning development, including
:ref:`libraries <artificial-intelligence-apis>` for optimized deep learning operations and ROCm-aware versions of popular
deep learning frameworks and libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. ROCm works closely with these
frameworks to ensure that framework-specific optimizations take advantage of AMD accelerator and GPU architectures.

The following guides provide information on compatibility and supported
features for these ROCm-enabled deep learning frameworks.

* :doc:`PyTorch compatibility <../compatibility/ml-compatibility/pytorch-compatibility>`
* :doc:`JAX compatibility <../compatibility/ml-compatibility/jax-compatibility>`

.. * :doc:`TensorFlow compatibility <../compatibility/ml-compatibility/tensorflow-compatibility>`

This chart steps through typical installation workflows for installing deep learning frameworks for ROCm.
