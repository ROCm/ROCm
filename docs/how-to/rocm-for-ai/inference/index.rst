Use ROCm for AI inference
****************************
AI inference is a process of deploying a trained machine learning model to make predictions or classifications on new data. This commonly involves using the model with real-time data and making quick decisions based on the predictions made by the model.  

Understanding the ROCm™ software platform’s architecture and capabilities is vital for running AI inference. By leveraging the ROCm platform's capabilities, you can harness the power of high-performance computing and efficient resource management to run inference workloads, leading to faster predictions and classifications on real-time data.

Throughout the following topics, this section provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and deploying AI inference on AMD GPUs. This includes instructions on how to install ROCm, how to use Hugging Face Transformers to manage pre-trained models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, how to validate vLLM on AMD Instinct™ MI300X accelerators and illustrate how to deploy trained models in production environments. 

The AI Developer Hub contains `AMD ROCm tutorials <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/ai-developer-hub/en/latest/>`_ for
training, fine-tuning, and inference. It leverages popular machine learning frameworks on AMD GPUs.
