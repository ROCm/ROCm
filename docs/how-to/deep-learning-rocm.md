# Deep learning guide

The following sections cover the different framework installations for ROCm and
deep-learning applications. The following image provides
the sequential flow for the use of each framework. Refer to the ROCm Compatible
Frameworks Release Notes for each framework's most current release notes at
[Third party support](../about/compatibility/3rd-party-support-matrix.md).
