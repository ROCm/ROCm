AMD Instinct MI300X performance guides
**************************************

The following performance guides provide essential guidance on the necessary
steps to properly :doc:`configure your system for AMD Instinctâ„¢ MI300X
accelerators <../system-optimization/mi300x>`. They include detailed
instructions on system settings and application :doc:`workload tuning
<../rocm-for-ai/inference-optimization/workload>` to help you
leverage the maximum capabilities of these accelerators and achieve superior
performance.

* :doc:`../system-optimization/mi300x` covers essential system settings and
  system management practices to configure your AMD Instinct MI300X system for
  performance.

* :doc:`../rocm-for-ai/inference-optimization/workload` covers steps to
  optimize the performance of AMD Instinct MI300X series accelerators for HPC
  and deep learning operations.

* :doc:`../rocm-for-ai/inference/vllm-benchmark` introduces a preconfigured
  environment for LLM inference, designed to help you test performance with
  popular models on AMD Instinct MI300X series accelerators.
